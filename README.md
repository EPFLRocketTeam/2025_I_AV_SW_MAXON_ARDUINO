# Maxon Arduino Library

## Introduction

This repository is a custom Arduino Library for controlling maxon motors with epos4 via an RS232 communication. 
This library was written by Axel Juaneda to control the maxons of the gimbal for the Icarus project. 

The library was written using the following documentation:
- [EPOS4 UART Commanding](https://support.maxongroup.com/hc/fr/article_attachments/360018969133)
- [EPOS4 Communication Guide](https://www.maxongroup.com/medias/sys_master/root/8834324922398/EPOS4-Communication-Guide-En.pdf)
- [EPOS Studio](https://www.maxongroup.com/fr-ch/entrainements-et-systemes/commandes/commandes-de-positionnement) for register values

The implemented functionalities are limited to Icarus's needs but can easily be extended.
